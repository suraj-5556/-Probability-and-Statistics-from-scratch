Write a Python function to calculate the probability of observing exactly k events in a fixed interval using the Poisson distribution formula. The function should take k (number of events) and lam (mean rate of occurrences) as inputs and return the probability rounded to 5 decimal places.

Example:
Input:
k = 3, lam = 5
Output:
0.14037
Reasoning:
The function calculates the probability for a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval, based on the mean rate of occurrences.
