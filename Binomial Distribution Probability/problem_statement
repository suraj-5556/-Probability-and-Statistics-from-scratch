Write a Python function to calculate the probability of achieving exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success, using the Binomial distribution formula.

Example:
Input:
n = 6, k = 2, p = 0.5
Output:
0.23438
Reasoning:
The function calculates the Binomial probability, the intermediate steps include calculating the binomial coefficient, raising p and (1-p) to the appropriate powers, and multiplying the results.
